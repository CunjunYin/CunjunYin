# Virtualization

Virtualization is one of the foundation technology for cloud computing. It is a technology that enable Softwares and Operating Systems to run on top of the virtualization layer in many(or any) environment. Generally speaking virtualization is:
* A machine thatâ€™s implemented in software, rather than hardware
* A self-contained environment that acts like a computer
* An abstract specification for a computing device (instruction set, etc.)

In Virtualization  there are two important terminology `Host` and `Guest`. Host is the the underlying layer that provides `resources/APIs` to allow user to operate, and Guest is the virtualized `resources/APIs` on top of virtualization software and virtualization software is on top of Host, so Guest can share host resources/APIs.

## Types of virtualisation

Virtualisation can be applied in any level of computer system - from hardware to application level. 

### 1. Language Level virtualisation


### OS Level virtualisation

### Hardware Level virtualisation
This virtualisation is available right on top of the raw computing resources.
